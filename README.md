# RGB Peripheral_Central 
This code is used for changing RGB diode status through NUS (Nordic UART Service).
Through development I'm adding some features like security (fixed PIN).
Code made for my custom board based on NRF52832 QFN-48 SoC.
If there is anyone who understand NRF Connect for VSCode. Please let me know.
